RideLink (previously DriveJoy) is an online community where car owners can safely rent their cars directly to drivers, making money in the process. For car owners, this is a great way to let your car make extra cash when you're not using it, all while reducing the number of cars on the road and helping others.
For renters, RideLink offers a wider selection of awesome cars than you would find at a traditional car rental agency, at a fraction of the cost. Best of all, you always know the exact car you'll be getting; no last minute surprises at the rental counter.
